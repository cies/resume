At the age of seven (1989) Cies wrote his first lines of code in a \acr{LOGO}-like language on an \acr{MSX} (pre-\acr{PC}).  Two years later he attended a conference on an emerging new technology, the Internet, at the Erasmus University from which he would graduate 16 years later.

After being introduced to the open source movement in 1997, he taught himself a variety of skills including system administration and programming (Bash, Python, Ruby \& \CPP).  By 2002 he got his pet project \acr{KT}urtle ---a zero-entry-barrier programming environment--- included into \acr{KDE}'s \emph{edu} module, and thereby almost every Linux distribution.

From 2003 to 2007 he studied at the Erasmus University Rotterdam and graduated in \emph{Business and Computer Science} (one curriculum).  After graduation he travelled Europe and Asia during a two year sabbatical, on which he ``hustled'' several IT gigs (see experiences below) to extend the journey.
